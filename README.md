# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Implementations

Mathematical implementation of various machine learning algorithms: 

- Kernel Prediction (Gaussian, Mat`ern of order 2, Epanechnikov), 

- L1 and L2 regularization (ADMM and Proximal algoritm), 

- LDA (train and classification), 

- SVM algorithms (primal form and dual form)
